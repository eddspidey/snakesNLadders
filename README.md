# Snakes and Ladders Game

## Board Rules 
### 1. You can configure the board and all the components from src/main/resources/application.properties.
### 2. Size of board can't be zero or negative.

## Snake & Ladder Rules
### 1. Snakes and Ladder can't have negative starting or ending point.
### 2. Ladders and Snakes can't have a single point of intersection, i.e, both head of snake and ladder can't be at the same point.
### 3. Ladder will only take player up and Snake will only take player down.
### 4. Snake can't be placed at end position
### 5. Ladder can't be placed at starting position
### 6. Snake can't take player to negative number nor can Ladder take player to more than board-size.

## Player Rules
### 1. Total Number of players can't be zero/negative.
### 2. Total chance of a player can't be zero/negative.
### 3. Player can't start without getting 6, although his chances will start deducting from the total count.
### 4. Player will be given a free chance if dice rolls 6 at the starting point.
### 5. Player has to wait to get to exact end-point if he/she comes near the end, i.e, if the player is at 98, he/she has to wait until dice gives 1 or 2. 

### NOTE : Player, Board and Jump classes were in my model directory but I mistakenly moved them to main directory and I didn't notice it until now, I'm out and I don't have the access to my system to fix it. :)

## Future Plan : 
### 1. Use MockMvc to properly call the services and use them in Test cases instead of directly calling the services and validations.
